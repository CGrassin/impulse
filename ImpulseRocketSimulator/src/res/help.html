<h1>Help - Impulse V0.1</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Impulse is a real-time physics simulator for gimbaled thrust rockets. It is a useful tool
for the design phase of the rocket and the controller algorithm tests and validation.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> aerodynamic forces are not implemented yet
in this simulator.</p>

<h2>Quick start guide</h2>

<p>This paragraph describes how to start a simulation with a custom rocket.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create the rocket.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the "Rocket Settings" tab;</li>
		<li>Change the settings according to your needs 
		(see the "Rocket settings" help, below);</li>
		<li>Click on the "Apply" button.</li>	
	</ol>
	<li>Set up the controller: configure the PID controller and click the 
	"Set PID" button, or connect to a rocket controller board through a
	serial link, with the "Connect..." button (see the "Controller
	 settings" help, below).</li>
	<li>Launch the real-time simulation by clicking the "Launch" button.
	It stops when the rocket touches the ground, or when the "Stop" button
	is pressed.</li>	
</ol>

<h2>The interface</h2>

<p>There are 5 tabs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Angular motion:</strong> the 3 graphs display the real-time angular kinetics
	of the rocket (acceleration, speed and angle);</li>
	<li><strong>Linear motion:</strong> the 3 graphs display the real-time linear kinetics
	of the rocket (acceleration, speed and position);</li>
	<li><strong>3D view:</strong> a more user-friendly 3D visualization of the flight of the 
	simulated rocket;</li>
	<li><strong>Rocket settings:</strong> the configuration of the simulated rocket (mass,
	size, motor, etc.). All these variables are detailed below;</li>
	<li><strong>Help:</strong> the current tab, with information about the simulator.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get quick information about a specific menu/button, hover it with the mouse for about
3s. A tooltip will pop-up and provide quick instructions.</p>

<h2>Rocket settings</h2>

<p>In Impulse, a Rocket is made of 3 parts: a cylindrical body, a thruster and a thruster gimbal.
The rocket configuration is in the "Rocket Settings" tab.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Total mass:</strong> the mass of the rocket, in kilograms, including the motor;</li>
	<li><strong>Length:</strong> the total length of the rocket, from the thruster to the cone, in meters;</li>
	<li><strong>Rocket center of mass is centered?:</strong> the checkbox selects whether the CoM
	is assumed to be in the center of the rocket, or if you wish to set a more precise location. I
	strongly recommend to unchecked this and enter the real CoM position
	as it may have a strong impact on the effect of the thrust gimbal torque;</li>
	<li><strong>CoM height:</strong> only displayed if the checkbox is unchecked. The position of the CoM, 
	relative to the thruster, in meters. It can be precisely measured using CAD software or the real rocket;</li>
	<li><strong>Body diameter:</strong> the diameter of the cylindrical body of the rocket, in meters;</li>
	<li><strong>Motor:</strong> the thruster used to power the rocket. This list comes from the "motors.json"
	database in the Impulse.jar file. Any motor can be added with a custom thrust curve;</li>
	<li><strong>Gimbal max. angle:</strong> the maximum angular displacement the gimbal can perform.
	It is assumed to be symmetrical (i.e. 20 means that the gimbal can move from -20 to 20 degrees in 
	both X and Y axes);</li>
	<li><strong>Gimbal speed:</strong> the angular displacement speed of the gimbal, in degrees per 
	second. For instance, if you use servomotors, a typical speed should be indicated in their
	datasheet;</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the rocket model is fully configured, press "Apply" to create the rocket. A confirmation dialog
is displayed. It there are errors in the parameters, an error dialog is displayed, and the rocket is
not created.</p>

<h2>Controller settings</h2>

<p>The rocket controller is what moves the thrust gimbal to achieve stable flight.</p>

<h3>PID controller</h3>

<p>A <strong>proportional-integral-derivative controller</strong> (PID controller) is a control 
loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety 
of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.</p>

<p>Because it is the most commonly used controller, this simulator directly
implements it. Using the controls in the side-bar, the 4 coefficient can be
tweaked: Kp, Ki, Kd and its refresh frequency.</p>

<p>Please note that this functionality is not the way the simulator is 
supposed to be used. The recommended way is to use the serial controller
to validate the control algorithm on the real rocket hardware.</p>

<h3>Serial controller</h3>

<p>The serial controller is probably the most useful feature of this simulator.
It allows to code the control algorithm on the real rocket hardware, and to simulate
flight with this software.</p>

<p>This is how it works: the rocket micro-controller is connected to the computer
with a serial link. It can query data of the simulated rocket (angle, acceleration, etc.)
and send commands (eg. turn the gimbal to 15 degrees).</p>

<p>These are the available commands (115200 baud, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity bit):</p>
<ul>
	<li>"G": query the simulator the rocket attitude (angular position);</li>
	<li>"A": query the simulator the rocket linear acceleration;</li>
	<li>"B": query the simulator the rocket altitude;</li>
	<li>"GX 10.5": set the X thrust gimbal angle to 10.5 degrees;</li>
	<li>"GY 10.5": set the Y thrust gimbal angle to 10.5 degrees.</li>
</ul>

<p>A command must be followed by a line feed character (\n). In Arduino language, this is
done with the Serial.println function.</p>

<p>When answering a query, the simulator repeats the instruction and then delivers the output.</p>

<!--<p>Additionally, the simulator automatically sends "LAUNCH" when the
launch button is pressed, and "STOP" when the simulation stops.</p>-->
